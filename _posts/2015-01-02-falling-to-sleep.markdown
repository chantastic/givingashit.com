I hate falling to sleep.

I lie in been afraid that, fall to sleep, I'll never wake up. And if there's a hell, which I believe in, I'll wake up to find myself there. No do overs on that one.

I think about how terrible it would be to slip into a coma and be unable to communicate your state of mind—If that's how comas work. Shit. now I’m thinking about a long-term coma followed by a merciless afterlife.

This is what keeps me up some nights. It’s why I work until I pass out. All other nights I ask “please give me another day.”
