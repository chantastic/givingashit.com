I suck at writing.

I have my moments, sure. Everyone has moments. But sucking has kept me from writing and that’s a shame.

There’s no nobility here. There’s little I suspect anyone would get from reading this. But not-writing has caught up with me. I have notecards and binders and files and hard drives full of things I’ve thought about, none of them accessible. I’ve write things but it’s a mess. I can’t make any sense of it days, month, years later.

So, I make no claim to be funny or interesting or insightful. But I’ll be here noting states of things and how they feel.
